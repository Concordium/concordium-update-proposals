                      Protocol update commentary

Protocol Version: 3
Builds on Protocol Version: 2

This protocol update adds support for multiple addresses for the same
account. In protocol version 3 each account has 16777216 addresses.

This allows each account to have aliases for different uses and
creates a kind of sub-account structure. An account owner can give out
different aliases for different uses to keep track of transfers and
assign them meaning.
